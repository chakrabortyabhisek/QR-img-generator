# QR-img-generator
The QR image generator project is a web-based application that allows users to generate QR (Quick Response) codes for various purposes. It involves creating an HTML file, a CSS file for styling, and a JavaScript file for the QR code generation.

The HTML file provides the structure of the QR image generator. It typically includes a container element, which holds the input fields and buttons necessary for generating the QR code. Inside the container, there are input fields for the user to enter the desired data or URL that they want to encode as a QR code. Additionally, there is a button to trigger the QR code generation process, and an area to display the generated QR code.

The CSS file is responsible for styling the QR image generator's appearance. It defines the colors, fonts, button styles, and overall layout. CSS is used to make the generator visually appealing and user-friendly, ensuring that the input fields, buttons, and QR code display are properly aligned and easy to interact with.

The JavaScript file handles the logic for generating the QR code. It typically uses a QR code generation library, such as qrcode.js, to create the QR code based on the user's input. The JavaScript code assigns event listeners to the button, so when the user clicks the button, the code retrieves the input data and uses the QR code library to generate the corresponding QR image.
